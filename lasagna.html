      <h1>Italian <br>Lasagna</h1>

      <p><b>History:</b>Lasagna is one of Italy’s oldest pasta dishes, with origins tracing back to ancient Rome and even earlier Greek influences. The word “lasagna” comes from the Greek term laganon, meaning flat dough sheets. The dish evolved in Italy during the Middle Ages, especially in the Emilia-Romagna region, where layers of pasta, meat, and cheese became popular. Over time, different regions created their own versions—like Naples with richer tomato-based sauces—making lasagna a traditional comfort food loved across Italy and the world. </p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Recipe:</b>Lasagna is made by layering flat pasta sheets with flavorful meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and cheese. The meat sauce is cooked by sautéing onions and garlic in olive oil, adding minced beef or chicken, tomatoes, herbs, salt, and pepper, and simmering until thick. A béchamel sauce is made with butter, flour, and milk cooked into a smooth cream. In a baking dish, meat sauce is spread first, followed by lasagna sheets, then béchamel and mozzarella or parmesan. These layers are repeated, ending with cheese on top. The lasagna is baked until golden and bubbly, then served warm for a rich, comforting Italian flavour.</p>

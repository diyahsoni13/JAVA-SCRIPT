      <h1>Italian Dessert-<br>Tiramisu</h1>

      <p><b>History:</b>Tiramisu is believed to have originated in the Veneto region of Italy in the 1960s or 1970s. Although its exact origin is debated, many credit the dessert to restaurants in Treviso, where chefs created a layered sweet made with coffee, mascarpone, and ladyfingers for both energy and comfort. Over time, tiramisu became popular across Italy and eventually worldwide, becoming one of the most iconic Italian desserts due to its creamy texture and rich coffee flavor.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Recipe:</b>Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert made by layering coffee-soaked ladyfinger biscuits with a rich and creamy mixture of mascarpone cheese, sugar, and whipped cream. First, strong coffee or espresso is prepared and cooled. The ladyfingers are dipped lightly into the coffee so they stay soft but not soggy. In a bowl, mascarpone cheese is mixed with sugar and folded into whipped cream to create a smooth, fluffy filling. A layer of soaked ladyfingers is placed at the bottom of a dish, followed by a layer of mascarpone cream, and this process is repeated. The dessert is then chilled for several hours to set. Before serving, a generous dusting of cocoa powder is added on top, giving tiramisu its rich and signature flavor.</p>
	<p>To prepare, first brew and cool strong coffee, adding optional alcohol if desired. For the filling, whisk egg yolks and sugar until thick, gently cooking them over a double boiler or using pasteurized eggs. Beat the mascarpone until smooth and fold in the cooled egg yolk mixture. Separately, whip heavy cream or egg whites to stiff peaks and carefully fold into the mascarpone mixture. 
Assemble the tiramisu by quickly dipping ladyfingers in the coffee and arranging a layer in a dish. Spread half the cream mixture over the ladyfingers, then repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining cream. Chill the dessert, covered, for at least 6 hours or overnight to set and blend flavors. Before serving, dust the top with cocoa powder.    </p>

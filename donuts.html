      <h1>American<br>Donuts</h1>

      <p><b>History:</b>American donuts trace their origins to the early 1800s when Dutch settlers in the United States introduced “olykoeks,” or oily cakes, which were sweet fried dough balls. Over time, these evolved into ring-shaped donuts, a shape often credited to a sailor named Hanson Gregory in 1847, who claimed he cut out the center for more even cooking. Donuts grew even more popular in the 20th century with the rise of donut shops and chains, becoming a beloved part of American breakfast culture. Today, donuts symbolize comfort, creativity, and tradition, enjoyed in countless flavors and styles across the country. </p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Recipe:</b>To make classic American donuts, prepare a soft dough using flour, sugar, butter, milk, eggs, and a little yeast, then let it rise until doubled in size. Roll out the dough, cut it into ring shapes, and fry each piece in hot oil until golden and fluffy. Once cooked, place the donuts on paper towels to absorb excess oil. While still warm, coat them in sugar, cinnamon sugar, or glaze them with a simple icing made from powdered sugar and milk. Serve fresh for a sweet, soft, and delicious American-style treat. </p>
	<p>To make classic American-style donuts, first activate 2 1/4 teaspoons of active dry yeast in 1/4 cup warm water with a pinch of sugar until foamy. In a large bowl, combine this yeast mixture with 1 1/2 cups lukewarm milk, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 large eggs, 1/3 cup shortening (or butter), and about 2 cups of all-purpose flour. Gradually beat in the remaining 3 cups of flour to form a soft, slightly sticky dough, then knead on a floured surface for about 5 to 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. 
Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1 to 2 hours, or until doubled in size. Once risen, punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough to about a 1/2-inch thickness and use a floured donut cutter to cut out the shapes and center holes. Arrange the cut donuts and holes on parchment-lined baking sheets, cover them loosely, and let them rise again for another 30 to 60 minutes until puffed.  </p>

      <h1>American<br>Burger</h1>

      <p><b>History:</b>The American burger traces its roots to the late 1800s when German immigrants introduced the concept of “Hamburg steak” to the United States. Over time, cooks began placing the minced beef patty between two slices of bread to make it easy to eat on the go, giving rise to the modern hamburger. By the early 1900s, street vendors and diners helped popularize it, and the burger quickly became a symbol of American fast food culture. With the rise of famous chains in the 1920s and 1950s, the hamburger became deeply connected to American identity, representing convenience, flavor, and a love for simple comfort food.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Recipe:</b>To make a classic American burger, season ground beef with salt and pepper, then shape it into thick patties. Cook the patties on a grill or pan until they are browned and juicy. Lightly toast the burger buns, then layer in lettuce, tomato slices, onion rings, and crunchy pickles. Place a cooked patty on the bottom bun, add a slice of cheese if desired, and top it with ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise. Close the bun and serve warm for a simple, delicious homemade American-style burger. </p>
	<p>To make a classic American burger, gently combine one pound of 80/20 ground beef with simple seasonings like salt and pepper (some prefer to add Worcestershire sauce and onion powder for extra flavor). Avoid overmixing the meat to keep the patties tender, then shape into four patties, making a small indentation in the center of each to prevent them from puffing up during cooking. Grill or pan-fry the patties over medium-high heat for about 4 to 6 minutes per side, until they reach an internal temperature of 160°F (71°C). During the last minute of cooking, top each patty with a slice of American or cheddar cheese and cover briefly to let it melt. Meanwhile, lightly butter and toast the cut sides of the hamburger buns on the grill or in a pan until golden brown. Assemble the burger by spreading your choice of condiments (ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise) on the bun, then adding fresh toppings like lettuce, tomato slices, onion rings, and pickles before adding the finished patty and the top bun. </p>

      <h1>Indian<br>Biryani</h1>

      <p><b>History:</b>Veg biryani has its roots in the Mughal era, where aromatic rice dishes were created by combining spices, herbs, and meat. Over time, vegetarian versions became popular across India, especially in regions like Hyderabad, Lucknow, and South India. It evolved into a festive dish known for its rich flavor, layered cooking, and fragrant basmati rice. </p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Recipe:</b>To make veg biryani, basmati rice is partially cooked and layered with sautéed vegetables like potatoes, carrots, beans, and peas along with biryani masala, yogurt, and fried onions. The layers are sealed and cooked on low heat (dum) until the rice absorbs all the flavors. Garnished with coriander, mint, and a little ghee, veg biryani is served hot with raita for a complete, aromatic meal. </p>

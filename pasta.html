      <h1>Italian<br>Pasta</h1>

      <p><b>History:</b> Italian pasta became popular around the 12th century, especially in Sicily where Arab influence introduced dried noodles. Over time, pasta spread across Italy and grew into a traditional and global favourite.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Recipe:</b> Boil pasta in salted water until soft. In a pan, heat olive oil and sauté garlic, onions, and tomatoes. Add salt, pepper, chilli flakes, and Italian herbs. Stir in tomato sauce and mix in the cooked pasta. Toss well for 2–3 minutes and serve hot with cheese and basil.</p>
	<p>To prepare a simple and delicious Italian Pasta, begin by cooking your desired amount of penne in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package directions until it is al dente, then drain and set aside, reserving a small amount of the pasta water. Simultaneously, in a large pan, heat a generous amount of good quality olive oil over medium heat and sauté finely chopped garlic until fragrant, being careful not to burn it. Add thinly sliced onions and a mix of colorful bell peppers, cooking for a few minutes until they are slightly tender but still retain some crunch. Once the vegetables are ready, add the cooked pasta to the pan, tossing it well to coat everything in the flavored oil and vegetables. Season generously with dried oregano, red chili flakes, salt, and pepper to taste. Finally, stir in some sliced black olives and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice for brightness, adding a splash of the reserved pasta water if needed to help the sauce emulsify and coat the pasta evenly. Garnish with fresh parsley or basil and serve immediately, perhaps with some garlic bread or a side salad. </p>

      <h1>American<br>Apple Pie</h1>

      <p><b>History:</b>American apple pie is one of the most iconic desserts in the United States, often symbolizing comfort and tradition. Although apples are not native to North America, European settlers brought apple seeds and trees in the 1600s. Over time, as apple orchards spread across the country, pie-making became a common way to use the fruit. By the 18th and 19th centuries, apple pie had become a popular household dish. The phrase “as American as apple pie” became famous during the 20th century, showing how strongly the dessert became connected to American culture, family gatherings, and celebrations.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Recipe:</b>A classic American apple pie is made by first preparing a flaky crust using flour, cold butter, a little sugar, salt, and ice water, then chilling the dough. For the filling, thinly sliced apples are mixed with sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, flour, and a bit of lemon juice. The first rolled-out dough is placed in a pie pan, filled with the spiced apple mixture, and dotted with small pieces of butter. The second dough is rolled and placed on top, edges are sealed, and small slits are cut for steam. The pie is baked at 200°C (400°F) for 20 minutes, then at 180°C (350°F) for 30–35 minutes until golden and bubbly. It is best enjoyed warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. </p>
	<p>To make a classic American apple pie, begin with a flaky double crust pastry (store-bought or homemade), ensuring one disc lines a 9-inch pie dish and the second is ready for the top. For the filling, combine about 6-8 cups of peeled, cored, and thinly sliced firm apples (such as Granny Smith or Honeycrisp) with a mixture of granulated and/or brown sugar, a thickening agent like flour or cornstarch, warm spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg, and a splash of lemon juice to prevent browning and enhance flavor. Pour the apple mixture into the prepared bottom crust, dot with small pieces of butter, then cover with the top crust, which can be a full circle with vents cut for steam release or a decorative lattice. Seal and crimp the edges, brush the top with an egg wash for a golden sheen, and sprinkle with a little sugar for a sweet, crunchy finish. Bake the pie at a high temperature (around 425°F) for the first 15-20 minutes to set the crust, then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F or 375°F and continue baking for another 40-50 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly and tender. Allow the pie to cool on a wire rack for at least 2-3 hours before slicing; this crucial step allows the filling to thicken and set properly. Serve the pie warm or at room temperature, perhaps with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, for a truly classic American dessert experience.</p>

      <h1>Italian<br>Pizza</h1>

      <p><b>History:</b>Italian pizza has its roots in Naples during the 18th century, where flatbreads topped with tomatoes became popular among the working class. It gained worldwide fame in 1889 when the classic Pizza Margherita was created for Queen Margherita of Italy, featuring tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil to represent the colors of the Italian flag. Over time, pizza spread across Italy and eventually around the world, becoming one of the most beloved foods globally.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Recipe:</b>To make Italian pizza, start by preparing a soft dough using flour, yeast, warm water, olive oil, salt, and a little sugar. Let the dough rise until it doubles. Roll it into a thin round base and spread a simple tomato sauce made with crushed tomatoes, garlic, salt, and Italian herbs. Add fresh mozzarella and a few basil leaves. Bake the pizza at a high temperature until the crust turns crispy and the cheese melts. Serve hot for an authentic Italian taste.</p>
	<p> To make a classic Italian pizza, begin by preparing the dough using high-protein "00" flour, water, yeast, salt, and olive oil, then knead it until smooth and elastic. For a richer flavor and texture, it is recommended to let the dough ferment slowly, ideally refrigerated for 24 hours or more, before dividing and shaping it by hand to preserve the air bubbles. While the dough rests, prepare a simple sauce with crushed San Marzano tomatoes, a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and fresh basil, avoiding the use of excessive ingredients or sugar. 
Once ready, stretch the dough into a thin circle, leaving a slightly thicker border for the crust. Spread a light, even layer of the tomato sauce over the base, then top with slices of good quality, drained fresh mozzarella cheese. Bake the pizza in a preheated oven at the highest possible temperature (around 450°F to 500°F or 250°C) for about 5-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. For a final, authentic touch, garnish with a few fresh basil leaves immediately after removing the pizza from the oven, slice, and serve hot with an optional drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. </p>
